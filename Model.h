/** TODO:
		Can delegate the computation to the DiscountCurve; just reuse the Îµ - eps
		Add Black-Scholes choice for put call.
		Create h/cpp for finite difference methods and finite element methods
		
		Don't do the numerical approximation in the model; delegate to the DiscountCurve
		DupireModel
		VolatilitySurface -> Greeks -> Calibration [+interpolation methods] = Study of Volatility
		Pricing under DupireModel

		VolSurface = implied from market data/prices
		Give me prices/data I will reconstruct the VolSurf which is being priced in by the traders

		yield-curve and VolSurface = backbone of the market data
		IVolSurf is viewed as initial vol for the SVM
		DiscountCurve is viewed as initial rate for StochasticIntRates

		We assume we got data and so we can calibrate - we just design the class/blueprints
		Most important: How we will represent the data; list of tenors, strikes and ImpVols matrix [raw data]
		Model needs to have continuous -> ex/interpolations schemes! Determines the robustness of the model

		HOMEWORK:
			1. See the notes: interpolation cubic spline - along strikes for 1 tenor, then do Thomas algo per
			VolSurface - give me a value I need to interpolate, then go to InterpScheme and get it done.
			InterpolationSchemes.hpp/cpp with multiple methods
		Careful: Cubic spline only works when we interpolate the strikes, interpolating along the tenor we will need information set of curves and interpolate in between the curves.

		Market data is for market data team
		Pricing lib must have proper yield-curve, IV-surface, then interpolate and get the model, then becomes the input for my calibration.
		What is market data, modelling assumption + interpolations!

		Stochastic Interest Rates

		HestonModel

		Generalise the BlackScholesModel for non-constant rates

	PDE: 
		Grid construction
		Boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin)
		Numerical derivatives (1st, 2nd order, mixed)
		Time-stepping schemes (Explicit, Implicit, Crank-Nicolson)
		Tridiagonal solvers (Thomas algorithm)
		Stability analysis
